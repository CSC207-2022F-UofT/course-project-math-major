## Project Requirements
- SDK: Amazon Correto version 18.0.2
- Language Level: SDK default(18)

##Design Pattern
RankingSystem:
- Factory: this design pattern is only used when the rating systems and the recipe creating system not constructed
  This class has createRank() and getInstance() method for generating and obtain temporary test instance.
- Comparator: Rank uses RankingComparactor as a design pattern when two rated recipe need to be compared.
- Observer: the ranking and scoring system also uses an observer pattern so that the program can efficiently handle each recipe update.
